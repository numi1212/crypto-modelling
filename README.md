# crypto-modelling
This project analyzes the historical price data of Bitcoin, the world's first and most dominant cryptocurrency. Using daily data from 2014 to the present — sourced from Kaggle — the project explores long-term price trends, trading volume patterns, and major market movements. All analysis was conducted in R using tidyverse packages and documented in a Quarto website. The project is part of [Kane’s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/) and demonstrates how raw financial data can be transformed into clear, insightful visualizations using modern data science tools.
