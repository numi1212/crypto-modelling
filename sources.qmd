The dataset for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anukaggle81/top-100-crypto-currency-historical-dataset), which contains historical daily price data for the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Specifically, I used the file `bitcoin.csv`, which provides Bitcoinâ€™s open, high, low, close prices, trading volume, and other related fields from 2014 onward.

To prepare the dataset for analysis, I cleaned the column names for consistency, converted the date column to proper `Date` format using `lubridate`, and removed unnecessary fields such as dividends and stock splits, which are not applicable to cryptocurrencies. The dataset also contained an index column that was dropped during cleaning.

No observations were removed during preprocessing. The dataset appears to be complete, with daily data points for nearly 10 years, offering a solid foundation for time series analysis and visualization.
